# Module

- A module is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates related functionality. Modules help organize code into logical units, making it easier to manage and maintain large applications.
- Modules are a fundamental concept for organizing code, and the CommonJS module system is used. Each file in a Node.js application is treated as a module, and you can use the require function to import functionality from other modules.
